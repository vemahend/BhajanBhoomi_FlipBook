        <h1>Namaste! I'm <span class="highlight">Venkatesh Mahendru</span></h1>
        <p>Creator of <span class="highlight">Bhajan Bhoomi</span>, a platform dedicated to sharing spiritual wisdom.</p>
        <p>After moving to <span class="highlight">New Zealand</span>, I found it difficult to access spiritual books and bhajans. This inspired me to create Bhajan Bhoomi, a space where sacred texts, aartis, and hymns are easily available for everyone.</p>
        <p>With a deep passion for <span class="highlight">Indian culture, devotion, and spiritual growth</span>, my goal is to provide a peaceful digital space for seekers. May your journey be blessed with light and devotion. 🙏</p>
        <p class="special-thanks">✨ Special thanks to my wife, <span class="highlight">Deepali Mehra</span>, whose unwavering support and encouragement have been instrumental in bringing Bhajan Bhoomi to life. 🙏</p>
